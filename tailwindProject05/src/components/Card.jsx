// In react , Every functional component have the access to the feature called as props.
// In React, "props" is a short form of "properties," and it's a fundamental concept for passing data from one component to another. 
// Props are a crucial aspect of building React applications, as they facilitate the composition and reusability of components by enabling communication between them.

// instead of writng the props as parameter we can directly pass the evaluated expresiion in the paranthesis as well as in the html tag.


// Other wise if the value of the evaluated expression is none like the 3 <div/>, we pass that on the App() as the parameter as if all the non writen evaluated expression will be that passed parameter.
